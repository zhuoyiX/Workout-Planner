# Workout-Planner
This is an application about fitness, gym and workout

1. We implement a Workout Library to provide users information about each workout.
   There are tutorial video, graph showing which part is trained, and text description about instructions.
2. We import Firebase as our database, and by that we created a list to store user's customize plan. 
3. We implement a Timer for user to use, and we hope it will help them to better perform
4. We also import a oepen source project called Runner Tracker. This is a program will track user's outdoor activity.
   It will store information such as distance, speed and when user finishes their run, it will create a draw of the path.
